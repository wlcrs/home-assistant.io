This integration provides support for Internet Radios based on the [Frontier Silicon chipset]. Some of the manufacturers which offer products based on these chips include: Hama, Medion, Slivercrest, Auna, Technisat, Revo, Pinnel, etc. These devices will be usually controlled by the [UNDOK] app.

## Supported Models
* Hama: [IR110], [DIR3110]
* Medion: [Medion Radios]
* Silvercrest: [SIRD 14 C2]
* Teufel: [Radio 3sixty(2019)]
* Roberts: [Roberts Stream 94i]
* Some models from: Auna, Technisat, Revo, Pinell, Como Audio

This integration was developed and tested with a [Roberts Stream 94i].

## Configuration

The integration supports automatic discovery of your Internet Radio. If you need to setup the device manually, please provide the device URL, which is typically something like `http://[host]/device`. Some models use a separate port (2244) for API access, this can be verified by visiting http://[host]:[port]/device.

The default PIN for Frontier Silicon-based devices is 1234. You can set the PIN code of your device (depending on manufacturer) under:
*MENU button > Main Menu > System setting > Network > NetRemote PIN setup*

The "Force session usage" option [can typically remain unchecked](#fsapi-session-note).


In case your device (friendly name) is called *badezimmer*, an example automation can look something like this:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml automation
alias: "Bathroom Motion Detected"
trigger:
  platform: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.motion_sensor_166d0001171111
  from: "off"
  to: "on"
action:
  service: media_player.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: "media_player.badezimmer"
```

## Development

Support is provided through the Python [afsapi] module. The Python module was developed by using the documentation provided by [flammy] and
is based on [tiwillam]'s fsapi project. Special thanks to both developers, this integration would have not been possible without their work.

## Notes and Limitations

<div class='note warning' name="fsapi-session-note">

Some older devices may require setting up a session to process requests. If this is the case, check the "Force session usage" to get the legacy implementation of this integration.

The legacy implementation of the Frontier Silicon API does not provide a multi-user environment. There is always a single user (session) controlling a device, which means that once Home Assistant connects to a device all other sessions will be invalidated. This renders the usage of [UNDOK] almost impossible, as the Home Assistant integration polls the device state every 30 seconds or issues a command by creating a new session.
*If you want to prevent Home Assistant to auto connect to your device, simply change the PIN code of the device to something else than: 1234*
